    "**Winnipeg**, a city located in the heart of Canada - Manitoba, will be the focus of this project as we will explore through this 'cool' city for the right location of setting up a restaurant.

    "A nice grilled kebob shawarma goes well with the cold eh? Well a nice location makes the experience better. So we are interested in a couple of location categories, for starters we would like to **setup near the city's hub**. An important factor would be to look at **areas with good levels of personal safety** (low crime activity). Watching out for competition too, we would be interested in places with **less restaurants or having no similar Middle Eastern restaurant** close by. And also being close to **food markets** would make a timely regulation of fresh food items for restaurant service. \n",
